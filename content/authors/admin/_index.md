After completing a degree on Veterinary medicine (DVM) at the Extremadura University (UNEX, Spain), in 2017 I obtained a PhD on Animal Production at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB, Spain). 

From 2017 to 2020, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher sharing my time between the [Animal Genetics and Integrative Biology (GABI)](https://www6.jouy.inrae.fr/gabi_eng/ "Animal Genetics and Integrative Biology (GABI)") research unit in the [Animal Genetics](https://www.inrae.fr/en/divisions/animal-genetics "Animal Genetics") division of [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en "INRAE") in Jouy-en-Josas (France), and the [Systemic modeling applied to ruminants (MoSAR)](https://www6.jouy.inrae.fr/mosar_eng/UMR-MoSAR "Systemic modeling applied to ruminants (MoSAR)") research unit in the Animal Physiology and Livestock Systems (PHASE) division of [AgroParisTech](http://www2.agroparistech.fr/Welcome-to-AgroParisTech.html "AgroParisTech") in Paris (France).   

During this time my research interests were related to applied statistical and computational tools to understand the genetic basis of complex traits in pigs. 

Since 2020, I joined [Hendrix Genetics](https://www.hendrix-genetics.com/en/ "Hendrix Genetics") company headquartered in Boxmeer (the Netherlands) as a Geneticist working on genotypes and genomic evaluations at multi-species animal breeding (-swine, -turkeys, -layers, -poultry, -salmon, -shrimp and -trout).
